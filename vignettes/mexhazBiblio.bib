   abstract = {flexsurv is an R package for fully-parametric modeling of survival data. Any parametric time-to-event distribution may be fitted if the user supplies a probability density or hazard function, and ideally also their cumulative versions. Standard survival distributions are built in, including the three and four-parameter generalized gamma and F distributions. Any parameter of any distribution can be modeled as a linear or log-linear function of covariates. The package also includes the spline model of Royston and Parmar (2002), in which both baseline survival and covariate effects can be arbitrarily flexible parametric functions of time. The main model-fitting function, flexsurvreg, uses the familiar syntax of survreg from the standard survival package (Therneau 2016). Censoring or left-truncation are specified in 'Surv' objects. The models are fitted by maximizing the full log-likelihood, and estimates and confidence intervals for any function of the model parameters can be printed or plotted. flexsurv also provides functions for fitting and predicting from fully-parametric multi-state models, and connects with the mstate package (de Wreede, Fiocco, and Putter 2011). This article explains the methods and design principles of the package, giving several worked examples of its use.},

   abstract = {Frailty models are getting more and more popular to account for overdispersion and/or clustering in survival data. When the form of the baseline hazard is somehow known in advance, the parametric estimation approach can be used advantageously. Nonetheless, there is no unified widely available software that deals with the parametric frailty model. The new parfm package remedies that lack by providing a wide range of parametric frailty models in R. The gamma, inverse Gaussian, and positive stable frailty distributions can be specified, together with five different baseline hazards. Parameter estimation is done by maximising the marginal log-likelihood, with right-censored and possibly left-truncated data. In the multivariate setting, the inverse Gaussian may encounter numerical difficulties with a huge number of events in at least one cluster. The positive stable model shows analogous difficulties but an ad-hoc solution is implemented, whereas the gamma model is very resistant due to the simplicity of its Laplace transform.},

It is well adapted to the analysis of recurrent events such as cancer relapses and/or terminal events (death or lost to follow-up). The approach uses maximum penalized likelihood estimation. Right-censored or left-truncated data are considered. It also allows stratification and time-dependent covariates during analysis.},

   abstract = {When analyzing correlated time to event data, shared frailty (random effect) models are particularly attractive. However, the estimation of such models has proved challenging. In semiparametric models, this is further complicated by the presence of the nonparametric baseline hazard. Although recent years have seen an increased availability of software for fitting frailty models, most software packages focus either on a small number of distributions of the random effect, or support only on a few data scenarios. frailtyEM is an R package that provides maximum likelihood estimation of semiparametric shared frailty models using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The implementation is consistent across several scenarios, including possibly left truncated clustered failures and recurrent events in both calendar time and gap time formulation. A large number of frailty distributions belonging to the power variance function family are supported. Several methods facilitate access to predicted survival and cumulative hazard curves, both for an individual and on a population level. An extensive number of summary measures and statistical tests are also provided.},
