Changes in Version 1.1

  Majors changes (no backward compatibility)! See help files for a
  full explanation of the arguments and outputs of the functions.

  o The 'bound' argument of the 'mexhaz' function has been renamed
  'bo.max'.

  o The 'pl.nlm' argument of the 'mexhaz' function has been suppressed
  (it is still possible to print information from the nlm optimisation
  procedure by supplying the argument 'print.level' which will be
  directly passed to nlm).

  o The output of the 'mexhaz' function has been modified to
  facilitate the application of S3 methods. The object returned by the
  'mexhaz' function is a list of class 'mexhaz'.

  o Methods plot() and summary() for an object of class 'mexhaz' have
  been added.

  o The 'pred.mexhaz' function has been renamed 'predMexhaz' and its
  arguments have been modified: the 't' and 'nb.time.pts' have been
  replaced by a single argument 'time.pts' which requests the user to
  give a vector of time points at which the predictions are to be
  made; the 'delta' argument has been replaced by a 'conf.int'
  argument which allows the user to select the method for confidence
  limits calculation ("none", "delta", or "simul").

  o A bug in the 'pred.mexhaz' (now, 'predMexhaz') function has been
  fixed: in the previous version, supplying a data.frame of
  covariables containing more than one line AND multiple time points
  (that is, trying to predict hazard/survival for different
  individuals at different time points) resulted in an abortion of the
  current R session. The problem has been solved by preventing such a
  situation to occur.

  o The Delta Method is now available for models using a B-spline of
  degree 1 for the logarithm of the baseline hazard and for models
  using a piecewise constant hazard.

  o The output of the 'predMexhaz' function has been modified to
  facilitate the application of S3 methods. The object returned by the
  'predMexhaz' function is a list of class 'predMexhaz'.
        

  o Methods print(), plot() and points() for an object of class
  'predMexhaz' have been added.
    
  o The function 'graph.mexhaz' has been suppressed (the methods
  plot() and points() are to be used instead).
